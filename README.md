# FinBOT

FinBOT is a financial assistant chatbot designed to empower users with real-time financial insights, document-based query responses, and general financial guidance. It offers four distinct interaction modes—General Queries, Chat with PDF, Chat with Live Data, and Chat with Live Voice—to cater to a variety of user needs. 

Leveraging cutting-edge AI technologies, vector databases, and scalable cloud deployment solutions like Docker and Kubernetes, finBOT delivers a robust, reliable, and user-friendly experience.

## Features

- **Multiple Interaction Modes**: Seamlessly switch between general financial questions, PDF document analysis, live data retrieval, and voice-based interactions.
- **Real-Time Data Integration**: Connects to external APIs such as Yahoo Finance, NewsAPI, and CoinGecko for the latest financial data.
- **Document Querying**: Upload PDF documents and ask specific questions about their contents using advanced text extraction and semantic search.
- **Voice Capabilities**: Redirects to an external platform for hands-free, voice-driven financial queries.
- **Reliability Assurance**: Features a fallback mechanism to ensure uninterrupted service if the primary language model encounters issues.
- **Scalable Architecture**: Packaged in Docker containers and deployable on Kubernetes for high availability and scalability.

## Modes of Operation

### 1. General Queries

**Purpose:** Provide direct answers to general financial questions using a large language model (LLM).

#### How It Works:
1. **Input:** Users input a question (e.g., "What is diversification in investing?") through the Streamlit web interface.
2. **Processing:**
   - The query is sent to Google’s `gemini-2.0-flash-exp` LLM using functions from `tools/llm_chat_tool.py`.
   - The conversation history is maintained using `st.session_state.gemini_history`.
3. **Output:** The response is streamed back to the user in real-time.

**Example:**
```text
User Input: "What is diversification in investing?"
Response: "Diversification in investing refers to spreading your investments across various asset classes..."
```

### 2. Chat with PDF

**Purpose:** Allow users to upload a PDF document and ask questions about its contents.

#### How It Works:
1. **Input:** Users upload a PDF and submit a query (e.g., "What is the profit margin in this report?").
2. **Processing:**
   - Extracts text using `MarkItDown`.
   - Chunks text using `SemanticChunker`.
   - Converts chunks into vector embeddings using `SentenceTransformer` (`all-MiniLM-L6-v2`).
   - Stores embeddings in a **Qdrant** vector database.
   - Uses a **retriever agent** to fetch relevant document chunks and an LLM to synthesize a response.
3. **Output:** The response is displayed in the chat UI.

**Example:**
```text
User Input: "What is the profit margin in this report?"
Response: "The profit margin for Q2 2023 is 18.5%..."
```

### 3. Chat with Live Data

**Purpose:** Deliver real-time financial information from external APIs.

#### How It Works:
1. **Input:** Users enter a query (e.g., "What’s the latest Tesla stock price?").
2. **Processing:**
   - The retriever agent identifies the relevant data source.
   - Uses tools from `tools/api_tools.py` (e.g., YahooFinanceTool, NewsAPITool, CryptoAPITool).
   - Synthesizes a response using the LLM.
3. **Output:** The response is displayed with source attribution.

**Example:**
```text
User Input: "What’s the latest Tesla stock price?"
Response: "Source: Yahoo Finance\nData: Tesla (TSLA) stock price: $230.45"
```

### 4. Chat with Live Voice

**Purpose:** Enable hands-free, interactive financial queries through voice, camera, or screen-based interactions.

#### How It Works:
Users can select from three distinct interaction modes via the sidebar:

1. **Voice Chat (Hands-Free Financial Assistance)**
   - Allows users to interact with the chatbot purely through voice commands.
   - Get real-time financial updates, stock insights, investment tips, and market trends without using a keyboard.
   - Ideal for users seeking quick hands-free assistance.

   **Example:**
   ```text
   User: "Hey FinBOT, should I invest in Tesla right now?"
   Response (audio): "Tesla's stock is currently at $800 with a strong growth trajectory. Analysts suggest holding for long-term gains."
   ```

2. **Camera Chat (Visual Financial Analysis)**
   - Uses the webcam to recognize financial documents, receipts, invoices, or charts.
   - Processes the scanned image using Gemini multimodal and provides insights.
   - Ideal for scanning bills, bank statements, or investment reports for instant breakdowns.

   **Example:**
   ```text
   User shows an invoice with multiple expenses.
   FinBOT: "Your total spending for this month is $2,500. Would you like a breakdown of discretionary vs. essential expenses?"
   ```

3. **Screen Chat (Interactive Graph & Chart Analysis)**
   - Users can share their screen to show stock market graphs, financial reports, or data tables.
   - The chatbot, powered by Gemini multimodal, analyzes the visuals and provides context-aware insights.
   - Ideal for traders and analysts who need real-time data-driven suggestions.

   **Example:**
   ```text
   User shares a live stock market graph.
   FinBOT: "This chart indicates an upward trend in Apple’s stock. Would you like a comparative analysis against Microsoft?"
   ```

#### Processing:

- Voice and visual inputs are handled by an external platform at `http://localhost:3000`.
- Speech-to-text conversion processes voice inputs.
- Image and screen analysis are done using multimodal AI.
- The LLM generates responses in text and audio formats.
- Text-to-speech converts the response back into audio for seamless interaction.

With these three modes, FinBOT offers an intuitive and accessible way to analyze financial information dynamically.
